This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Full Stack Developer Challenge

### Summary
![alt text](clean.png "default view")
* In this challenge you are tasked with allowing a user to visualize data for a Gaia series
* There are 2 main pieces of functionality:
  1. Implement an Express server route handler to request and transform data from multiple public Gaia content endpoints
  1. Implement a form in React (input and button) which takes `seriesId` as an input and fetches data for that series
* The final data will represent a series and up to 20 of its episodes
* All challenge requirements can be found in the [Acceptance Criteria Section](#acceptance-criteria)

### Pre-requisites
1. npm >= v5.2
   * Other package managers can be used so long as they are supported by `Create-React-App`
1. Nodejs >= v8.x
1. Two open terminals at the root of the application

### Running the project
1. From a terminal, run `$ npm install` to install dependencies.
1. Run `$ npm start` to start the React application.
1. In the other terminal, run `$ npm run server` to run the Express server.
1. View the running web app in your browser by navigating to `http://localhost:3000`.

### Orienting yourself
* Once the project is running, open the codebase in your editor of choice
* There are two files that will serve as the starting point
  * `/src/App.js`
  * `/src/server/index.js`
* Find the `TODO` comments in these files
* This challenge should take around 4 hours

### Guidelines
1. Install and use any packages you wish.
1. Add any folders and files you may need to organize your code.
1. Please spend no more than 4 hours for this exercise.

### Acceptance Criteria
**Please meet as many of the following criteria as you can in the allotted time**

1. Implement a simple form using React/Redux that accepts a numeric id value. This id corresponds to one of our original video series (`seriesId`).
   * Sample test values:
     1. `122881`
     1. `179166`
     1. `166896`
1. Use the `seriesId` to make a RESTful call to an API that responds with the metadata for the related series. You will implement the handler for this API endpoint. The handler should:
   * Use the `seriesId` included on the HTTP request to proxy another external HTTP request.
   * Process and transform the response data (details below) and serve it back in the response to the original request.
   * Handle any errors.
1. When receiving a successful, and well-formed response from the API service, the web app should render the following:
   * The hero artwork for the series.
   * The title for the series.
   * An ordered list of episode titles in ascending order.
   
_UX and layout requirements are detailed below._

#### Starting Points:
1. Express Server
   * Open `/src/server/index.js`
     * **Notice the two constants in the file:**
       1. `exampleNodeData`
       1. `exampleSeriesEpisodeData`
   * Implement an endpoint handler for `/series-videos` that:
     1. Fetches node data > http GET request to `https://brooklyn.gaia.com/node/[:nodeId]`
        * Data from this endpoint will look like `exampleNodeData`
        * Datapoints to use:
          * Series hero art -- `exampleNodeData.hero_image.hero_1070x400`
          * Series title -- `exampleNodeData.title`
     1. Then fetches Episode data > http GET request to `https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v2/videos/series/[:seriesId]`
        * Data from this endpoint will be an array of `exampleSeriesEpisodeData`
        * The route is paginated (please do **NOT** implement pagination)
          * The endpoint will return up to 20 episodes by default (use these)
        * All we want from this data is the episodes' title and the episodes' number
        * Iterate over the raw array of `exampleSeriesEpisodeData` and create an array of `basicEpisode`:
          ```js
          const basicEpisode = {
            episodeTitle: exampleSeriesEpisodeData.title,
            episodeNumber: exampleSeriesEpisodeData.episode,
          }
          ```
      1. Finally, return data in the form:
         ```js
         {
           seriesHeroArt: string,
           seriesTitle: string,
           episodeList: [ ..., {basicEpisode}, ... ],
         }
         ```
      1. Implement Catch logic to return meaningful errors to your client

1. React Application
   * **UI requirements:**
     * Responsive - **NO**
     * Content container - `width: 1070px;`
     * Form:
       * Label and button text are defined in the mock
       * Build to the mocks using your best estimation
     * Series data container:
       * Build to the mocks using your best estimation
   * **UX Requirements:**
     * Form `onSubmit`
       * Should:
         * make a request for series data using the `seriesId` provided by the user (valid `seriesId`'s in [Acceptance Criteria](#acceptance-criteria)
         * display processing/loading message while an http request is in transit
         * display any error messaging should an http request fail
       * Should not attempt to make a request if:
         * The input is empty
         * The app is already displaying data for the current `seriesId` form value
         * The user tries to use any non-numeric value for `seriesId`
         * There is already a request processing
     * [Form states](#form-states):
       * Processing - any time an http request is triggered by the form
         * Use a clear visual indicator that the application is processing a request
         * A simple 'Thinking' string is sufficient
       * Error - If the request returns an error
         * Use a clear visual indicator that the last request failed
         * A generic 'Request Failed' message is sufficient
